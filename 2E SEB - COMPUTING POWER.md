# Exp.No:2e  
## SEB - COMPUTING POWER

---

### AIM  
To write a Python program to compute the power of a given number using an appropriate built-in function.

---

### ALGORITHM

1. Begin the program.  
2. Input the base number (`base`) from the user.  
3. Input the exponent number (`exp`) from the user.  
4. Use the built-in `pow()` function to compute the base raised to the power of the exponent.  
5. Print the result using the `print()` function, displaying the power in a formatted output.  
6. Terminate the program.

---

### PROGRAM

```python
a=int(input())
b=int(input())
power=lambda a,b:pow(a,b)
print("Power of the given number is:",power(a,b))
```

### RESULT
Thus a Python program to compute the power of a given number using an appropriate built-in function was executed and implemented successfully.
